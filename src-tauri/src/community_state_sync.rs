//! Per-community state-CRDT sync — Phase 2 of ZEB-217 Sub-C.
//!
//! Mirrors the SHAPE of `crate::owner_state_sync::SyncEngine` but
//! multi-instance: one `CommunitySyncEngine` per joined community.
//! Each engine debounces local mutations into encrypted state-root
//! publishes, fetches remote state-root publishes from a per-community
//! Zenoh topic, DAG-syncs the encrypted blob via existing CAS
//! machinery, decrypts, and merges remote events into local
//! `CommunityState` after re-running `verify_event` per event.
//!
//! This file ships the AEAD helpers, the `CommunityRootPublishPayload`
//! wire type, the `CommunityRootHlcTracker`, and the
//! `CommunitySyncEngine` scaffold (construct + shutdown only — the
//! internal task is a stub). Subsequent tasks fill in the real
//! publish/subscribe loop and registry incrementally.
